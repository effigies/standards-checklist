## Bronze Certification
> This tool exists and is reasonably useable by (at least) advanced users, with minimal useability for basic users.

> TODO: Insert example Bronze cookie-cutter here.

### Intended audience
* users

### Documentation

- [ ] Landing page (e.g., GitHub README, website) provides a link to documentation and brief description of what program does
- [ ] Documentation is up to date with version of software
- [ ] Typical intended usage is described
- [ ] An example of its usage is shown
- [ ] Document functions intended to be used by users (public function docstring / help coverage ≥ 10%)
- [ ] Description of required input parameters for user-facing functions with reasonable description of inputs (i.e. "Nifti of brain mask in MNI" vs. "An image file")
- [ ] Description of output(s)
- [ ] User installation instructions available
- [ ] Dependencies listed (external and within-langugage requirements)

### Infrastructure

- [ ] Package is under version control.
- [ ] Readme is present.
- [ ] License is present.
- [ ] Issues tracking is enabled (either through GitHub or external site).
- [ ] Contributing guidelines (Intent of not maintenance?)
  - Adding NMinD template for users with important questions
- [ ] Digital Object Identifier (DOI) points to latest version (e.g., Zenodo)

### Code

No bronze-level requirements

### Testing

Some of these can be enforced by GitHub.

- [ ] If a package / compiled-code ― successfully builds / installs. If containerized, container available or build recipe succeeds
- [ ] Provide / generate / point to test data
- [ ] Provide instructions for users to run tests

### Explaination of requirements
 - Pointers on how to add these things (TODO)
 - Guiding principles (TODO)
 - Document tools used for determining coverage (TODO)

### Benefits of Bronze certification:
- [ ] Being able to cite the software in grant applications and publications! (DOI)
- [ ] Reasonable degree of certainty other will be able to install and use your code!
