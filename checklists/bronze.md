## Bronze Certification
> This tool exists and is reasonably useable by (at least) advanced users, with minimal useability for basic users.

> TODO: Insert example Bronze cookie-cutter here.

### Documentation

- [ ] Brief description of what program does is listed.
- [ ] An example of its usage is shown.
  - typical usage
- [ ] Description of required input parameters.
  - Reasonable description (i.e. "Nifti of brain mask in MNI" vs. "An image file")
- [ ] Description of output(s).


### Infrastructure

- [ ] Package is under version control.
- [ ] Readme is present.
- [ ] License is present.
- [ ] Issues tracking is enabled (either through GitHub or external site).
- [ ] Contributing guidelines (Intent of not maintenance?)
  - Adding NMinD template for users with important questions
- [ ] [Digital Object Identifier] - (Zenodo)


### Code

- [ ] Installation instructions available.
- [ ] Dependencies listed (External and within langugage requirements)
- [ ] >=50% of functions written within a codebase should be documented according to its style (e.g. docstrings for R/python, help for MATLAB)

### Testing

Some of these can be enforced by GitHub.

- [ ] If a package/compiled-code -- successfully builds/installs.
- [ ] Some way of providing testing for the user
    - [ ] Provide/generate/point to data for them to use, with an example usage command
    - [ ] For new changes to be merged, all tests need to pass.


### Explaination of requirements
 - Pointers on how to add these things (TODO)
 - Guiding principles (TODO)

### Benefits of Bronze certification:
- [ ] Being able to cite the software in grant applications and publications! (DOI)
- [ ] Reasonable degree of certainty other will be able to install and use your code!
